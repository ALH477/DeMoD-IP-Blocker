# DeMoD IP Blocker

A production-grade NixOS module for automated VPN and proxy blacklisting. This module uses kernel-level **ipsets** to manage up to 200,000 entries with near-zero latency and minimal CPU overhead.

---

## Core Logic

This module operates on a hybrid persistence model to ensure both network security and boot efficiency:

* **Odd Boots (1, 3, 5...)**: Probes the remote API for fresh data and updates the local cache.
* **Even Boots (2, 4, 6...)**: Skips the network request and loads rules directly from the encrypted local cache.
* **Fail-Safe**: If the cache is missing or the network is down, the system automatically adjusts to maintain active firewall protection.

---

## Key Features

* **Atomic Updates**: Uses `ipset swap` to refresh blacklists with zero downtime or traffic leakage.
* **Dual-Stack Support**: Automatically filters and generates independent IPv4 and IPv6 sets.
* **High Performance**: Utilizes `ipset restore` for batch loading rather than iterative shell loops.
* **Security Hardening**: Service is restricted with `ProtectSystem`, `PrivateTmp`, and `NoNewPrivileges`.

## Installation

Add the input to your `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs.demod-ip-blocker.url = "git+https://github.com/DeMoDLLC/demod-ip-blocker.git";
}

```

Import and enable the module in your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
  imports = [ inputs.demod-ip-blocker.nixosModules.default ];

  services.demod-ip-blocker = {
    enable = true;
    updateInterval = "24h"; # Background refresh for long uptimes
  };
}

```
